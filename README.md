While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see that your heart rate stays within a safe 
range suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to the American Heart Association 
(AHA), the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus 
your age in years. Your target heart rate is a range that’s 50–85% of your maximum heart rate. 
[Note: These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may 
vary based on the health, fitness and gender of the individual. Create a program that reads the 
user’s birthday (each consisting of the month, day and year) of 5 people. Your program should 
calculate and display the person’s age (in years), the person’s maximum heart rate and the 
person’s target-heart-rate range. The output should be displayed as follows with values beneath :
Persons Age(yrs)     Max Heart Rate    Target heart-rate Range
